Queues
======

There are several conflicting goals which scheduler needs to acheive.
It should:

1. prefer to crawl all domains;
2. prefer more promising links;
3. allow less promising links to be crawled with some probability
   (ε-greedy policy);
4. allow to update link priorities dynamically.

This module contains custom Scrapy queues which allow to do that:
:class:`BalancedPriorityQueue` allows to have per-domain request queues and
sample from them, :class:`RequestsPriorityQueue` is a per-domain queue
which allows to update request priorities.

    This queue samples other queues randomly, based on their weights

    "Bins" to balance should be set in ``request.meta['scheduler_slot']``.
    For each ``scheduler_slot`` value a separate queue is created.

    queue_factory should be a function which returns a new
    RequestsPriorityQueue for a given slot name.

    ``eps`` is a probability of choosing random queue and
    returning random request from it. Because sampling is two-stage,
    it is biased towards queues with fewer requests.

    ``balancing_temperature`` is a parameter which controls how to
    choose the queue to get requests from. If the value is high,
    queue will be selected almost randomly. If the value is close to zero,
    queue with a highest request priority will be selected with a probability
    close to 1. Default value is 1.0; it means queues are selected randomly
    with probabilities proportional to max priority of their requests.

    Requests are fetched in batches; ``batch_size`` is a parameter
    which suggests a number of non-random requests in a batch.
    Average size of actual batch is ``batch_size*(1+eps)``.
    When ``batch_size`` is set to None (default), a heuristic algorithm

    being balanced, the larger is a batch size.
